Hi! I am a PhD student in computer science (CS) at RWTH Aachen University affiliated
with the [Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/).
I am advised by Prof. Hermann Ney.
Previously, I completed my B.S in CS at the American University of Beirut
with full scholarship (USAID).
After that, I completed my M.S in Software Systems Engineering at
RWTH Aachen university with specializing in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

My personal research interests are:
- Recurrent networks, LSTMs
- Neural Attention models
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Acoustic Modeling
- End-to-end models for ASR
- Streaming ASR

For more details, you can find my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/resume.pdf).
