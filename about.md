Hi! I am a PhD student in computer science (CS) at RWTH Aachen University affiliated with the 
[Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/). 
I am advised by Prof. Hermann Ney. Previously, I completed my B.S in CS at the 
American University of Beirut with full scholarship (USAID). After that, I completed my M.S in 
Software Systems Engineering at RWTH Aachen university with specializing in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

My personal research interests are: 
- Recurrent networks, LSTMs
- Neural Attention models
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Language Modeling
